<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<p>I love solving puzzles and challenging myself. As such, I enjoy coding assignments given to me by my Professors. They're kind of difficult, to be honest, but nothing beats the pleasure once you write a couple hundred lines of code, and
it runs perfectly :-) <br> I haven't declared a CompSci major yet, but I hope to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science in the near future. </p>
<p>
I don't have a lot of cool projects yet, but feel free to take a look at my GitHub repos, from the links down below :-)

<div class="service">
<h3>Economics</h3>
<p>I find Economics to be a very interetsing subject. The complexities surrounding it are immense: the minute variables that are at play, the debates amongst the different schools of thought, the subject's relation to other academic topics
icluding, but not limited to Pyschology, Math, Antro, Sociology et cetera. In addition, I believe that seeing things from an Economist's perspective is an important life-skill as well.<br> As such, I hope to be graduating with a B.A
in Economics, although, still a Sophomore, I haven't declared the major yet.</p>

<h3>I don't know!</h3>
<p> I'm studying in a Liberal Arts college with an immense opportunity to explore myself. I still have time to declare a major, and in the case I don't want to major in CompSci & Econ, I still have time to change it . So, this is not exhaustive!!
I have also been thinking about a concentration, although I am not decided on any yet. Maybe History, Statistics or Math?? We'll see :-)</p>

<!~~ About me ~~>
<section class="about-me" id="about">
<h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">I'm a Nepali Student studying in the USA</p>

<div class="about-me__body">
<p>
I am a Nepali national, born and raised in Kathmandu. I did my A-Levels from Budhanilkantha School, after which I took a gap-year and came to Iowa, United States, to study at Grinnell College. Why'd I come here, from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu,
a city of around 3 million people, to Grinnell, a sleepy town with less than nine thousand people? Unsurprisingly, I do get that question a lot but the answer is kinda complicated, so if you ever talk or text me, I'd be happy to recount.
But in short, it was a combination of factors: scholarships, my uncle living nearby, developing independence away from home et cetera.
</p>

<p>
Other than my academic interests, I love learning and reading about history. I have certain phases every now and then when I go through every documentary, book or wikikpedia page there is about a certain historical topic. The topics are non-exhaustive,
and it'd be too long to list them down ^_^ <br> Other than that, I enjoy following the news, getting updated on current affairs, and reading about geo-politics :-) So if any one wants to talk to me about these stuffs, I'd
be happy to engage in a convo!
</p>
<P>
I also play some Computer Games every once in a while. So if anyone is up for a game of Arma 3, Call of duty, let me know!
